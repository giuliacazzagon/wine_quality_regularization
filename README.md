# Predict wine quality with Regularization

I am using the Wine Quality Dataset to classify a wine quality as good (>5 rating) or bad (<=5 rating). The goals of this project are to:
- implement different logistic regression classifiers
- find the best ridge-regularized classifier using hyperparameter tuning
- implement a tuned lasso-regularized feature selection method

**Data source:** The data for the project is the Wine Quality Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset).
